My final project for Introduction to Robotics (CS106A) with [Nicholas Liu](https://github.com/NickL77), Leo Liu, and [Kevin Shi](https://github.com/botkevin). B-AIR combines the Turtlebot platform, a RealSense depth camera, and a high-powered CPU fan to track, follow, and levitate a falling balloon. Feel free to check out the project website!

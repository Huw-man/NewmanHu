The [XR DeCal](https://xr.berkeley.edu/decal/)(previously the VR DeCal) is a student lead virtual reality development course. We teach students practical [Unity](https://unity.com/) development as well as VR/AR design concepts. Traditionally, we provide VR headsets and powerful laptops for our students to work with. However, given the move to remote classes in fall 2020 due to COVID19 I developed a new line of augmented reality lab assignments with [Daniel He](https://github.com/tcdanielh) and [Laryn Qi](https://github.com/LarynQi).

The assignment teaches Unity development with the AR foundation library. Working through the lab, students learn about 3D movement, ray casting, lighting, animations, ui, and image tracking.

The detailed lab assignment is available on the XR Decal's [website](https://xr.berkeley.edu/decal/labs_arfoundation) as well as all other course content.

I used to play a LOT of Catan. Nearly every night over the summer my friends and I would gather for an exciting match that usually ran late into the night. We had issues with our dice, so I wrote this dice roller to do the dirty work of generating random numbers. It takes random numbers from RANDOM.org which generates truly random numbers from atmospheric noise. This is actually my second version and the first version was a 2D dice roller with a helpful graph to track the numbers that were rolled.

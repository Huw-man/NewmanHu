title: Replit HTTPS by default
---

My first project completed during my internship at [Repl.it](https://repl.it/). This was a feature for improving the security of hosting on the Repl.it platform by pushing HTTPS by default. 

All details are available on this [blog post](https://blog.repl.it/https) which goes in depth about Replit's infrastructure for HTTPS and handling certificates.

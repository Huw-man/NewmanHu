I took the VR Decal which is a student lead course that teaches VR game development with Unity and Oculus Rift. For the final project my four-person group developed a creative sandbox game that allowed users to interact with their environment using “the Force” from Star Wars. Players have a great feel for the weight of virtual objects and our controls provide a very intuitive representation of what it would feel like as a Jedi. You can throw a wide assortment of objects at a large broken wall, play with an extremely heavy Jenga tower, or even pull down the moon if you have enough strength! Our project was very well received and nearly everyone loved the awesome feel of power from using the force. (This project is currently in further development by a third party so there is no public repo, but feel free to contact me for details! Also check out the demonstration video)

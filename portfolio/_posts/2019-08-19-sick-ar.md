I made an augmented reality damange and tamper detection application as part of my internship with SICK Sensor Intelligence. Its an android application that visualizes package information in AR and connects to a flask backend for analytics. Data about packages collected from various cameras, dimensioners, and scales across multiple facilities are aggregated by SICK's package analytics service. My application tracks whether a package has been damaged or tampered with during its journey from facility to facility and displays this information via an augmented reality interface.

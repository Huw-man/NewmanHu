I joined the ISAACS team in January 2020 and have contributed to its virtual reality interface and drone communication platform. This was a fantastic experience to expand my skills in Unity VR development and ROS as well as an opportunity to fly some expensive drones.

### Abstract
ISAACS is an undergraduate-led research group within the Center for Augmented Cognition of the VHL Vive Center for Enhanced Reality at the University of California, Berkeley. Our research is in human-UAV interaction, with a focus on teleoperation, telesensing, and multi-agent interaction. We are also part of the student group Extended Reality @ Berkeley, and collaborate with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to perform 3D reconstruction of the environment via state-of-the-art methods in radiation detection. Our vision is to create a scalable open source platform for Beyond Line of Sight Flight compatible with any UAV or sensor suite.

We also have a research paper coming soon! I'll link it here when its available.

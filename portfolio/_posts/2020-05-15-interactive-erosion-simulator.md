My final project for Introduction to Computer Graphics (CS184) in collaboration with [Dylan McLeod](https://github.com/dylan-mcleod) and [Hanlin Chen](https://github.com/hanlic1) was selected as a showcase winner amongst some other [amazing projects](https://cs184.eecs.berkeley.edu/sp20/article/39/final-project-showcase).

## Abstract
We create an interactive hydraulic erosion simulator for the procedural generation of natural terrain. Our simulation uses a shallow water fluid model and velocity field for calculating the erosion and deposition process. The entire simulation is developed to run on the GPU, using C++ and OpenGL, allowing for impressive framerates and full interactivity. Our model illustrates the effects of rain and river sources and allows users to place river sources to sculpt the landscape to their liking. Additionally, our application produces realistic water visualization with fully simulated waves, directional lighting, and textured terrain.

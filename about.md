# About

Hello! I'm currently a software engineering intern at [Repl.it](https://repl.it/) and a recent graduate from UC Berkeley with a B.S in EECS. My current interests are in VR/AR technology as well as robotics and AI. I'm looking for opportunities where I can leverage my interests with creative and ambitious people.

In my free time, I like doing miscellaneous activities like flying kites, video games, chess, snowboarding, and biking.
